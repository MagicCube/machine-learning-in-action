Machine Learning in Action (机器学习实战)

In this repository, it contains my personal implementations of several useful
and the most commonly used algorithms which are introduced in the MLiA book.

## Installation
The development environment requires numeric and scientific libraries like `numpy`,
`matplotlib`, `scipy`, etc.

The best way to get started is to install an [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
which is a all-in-one python platform. It also supports Intel MLK optimizations
which can dramatically improve the performance.

## Python Version
+ Python 3

## Code Style and Naming Convention
+ [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
+ [PEP 8 code style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
